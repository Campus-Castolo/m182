### **1. Explain the term *ICT resilience*.**

**ICT resilience** (Information and Communication Technology resilience) describes the ability of an organisation’s ICT systems to **withstand, absorb, recover from, and adapt to cyberattacks, technical failures, and other disruptions**.
It ensures that critical services remain available even when incidents occur.

---

### **2. Which five functions does the ICT Minimal Standard include?**

The Swiss ICT-Minimalstandard is based on the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**, and therefore includes these **five core functions**:

1. **Identify** – Understand assets, risks, dependencies.
2. **Protect** – Implement safeguards to limit the impact of incidents.
3. **Detect** – Discover cybersecurity events quickly.
4. **Respond** – Take action after an incident.
5. **Recover** – Restore systems and improve after the incident.

# **Document: Minimal Standard to Improve ICT Resilience**

### **3. Summarise the Management Summary in your own words.**

The ICT-Minimalstandard provides organisations in Switzerland with a **baseline for cybersecurity** to ensure the continuity of critical services. The document outlines a **structured, risk-based approach** for protecting essential ICT systems.
It describes best practices for identifying vulnerabilities, implementing adequate security measures, monitoring systems, responding to incidents, and restoring normal operations.
The goal is to **increase resilience**, reduce the impact of cyberattacks, and ensure the continuous supply of essential goods and services in Switzerland.

# **Introduction to the ICT Minimal Standard**

### **4. When (in which project phase) must ICT security principles be defined?**

**At the very beginning of a project — during the planning and design phase.**

### **5. Why?**

Because security must be **built into** the architecture from the start.
If principles are defined only later, systems may require costly redesigns or remain vulnerable. Early definition ensures:

* consistent security measures,
* proper risk assessment,
* compliance,
* and fewer vulnerabilities.

# **Defense-in-Depth**

### **6. Explain the term Defense-in-Depth in your own words.**

**Defense-in-Depth** is a security concept that uses **multiple layers of protection** so that if one layer fails, others still defend the system.
It combines technical, organisational, and physical measures to make attacks more difficult and their impact smaller.

### **7. What do the abbreviations ICS and APT mean?**

* **ICS** – *Industrial Control System* (technology used to control industrial processes such as power plants, factories, water systems).
* **APT** – *Advanced Persistent Threat* (highly skilled, well-funded attackers who stay hidden in a system for a long time).

---

### **8. Define what “stay undetected for a long time” means.**

This refers to attackers who infiltrate a system and **remain hidden for weeks, months, or even years**. They avoid triggering alarms, quietly gather information, escalate privileges, and prepare for sabotage or data theft before anyone notices.

---

### **9. List typical ICS attack methods.**

Common ICS attack methods include:

* **Phishing** to gain initial access
* **Exploiting outdated or unpatched systems**
* **Malware/Trojans** (e.g., Stuxnet-like attacks)
* **Unauthorized remote access**
* **Manipulation of PLCs/SCADA systems**
* **Network segmentation bypass**
* **Man-in-the-middle attacks** on industrial protocols
* **Supply chain attacks** (infecting vendors)

---

### **10. List factors that must be considered when applying a Defense-in-Depth concept.**

When applying Defense-in-Depth, organisations must consider:

* **Risk assessment and threat landscape**
* **Segmentation of networks** (especially IT/OT separation)
* **Access controls and least privilege**
* **Patch and vulnerability management**
* **Redundancy and backup strategies**
* **Monitoring and logging**
* **Incident response planning**
* **Physical security**
* **Employee training and awareness**
* **Consistency of policies and procedures**

---

# **NIST Framework**

### **11. What does NIST stand for?**

**NIST** stands for:
**National Institute of Standards and Technology** (USA).

---

### **12. What is the goal of the NIST Framework?**

The goal of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is to provide a **structured, widely applicable, risk-based approach** for organisations to:

* identify cybersecurity risks,
* protect systems,
* detect incidents,
* respond effectively,
* and recover quickly.

It helps organisations improve their **overall cybersecurity and resilience**.
